_Current code_

PrestaShop new architecture is already following PSR-2 coding style, just check it here : []()
For the main PrestaShop actual code, classes, controllers, etc. we will start to move all PrestaShop coding standards to PSR-2 following PrestaShop 1.6.1 Release.

Please be patient it's now easy to move all code without any bugs

_Pull request_

Factually the next Pull Request following PrestaShop 1.6.1 release must follow PSR-2 standards.

_What append with my pending code review Pull Request ?_

Don't worry, we will merge it as is and correct coding standards after.

_My PrestaShop module was developed following PrestaShop standards, are you fucking me?_

PrestaShop is changing, and we are trying to use common coding standards, don't worry about your module, it still be valid, and PrestaShop validator []() will no reject it. For your future modules, please follow PSR-2 coding standards and make community even better.
