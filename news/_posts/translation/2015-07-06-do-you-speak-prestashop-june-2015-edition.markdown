* Croatian
* Dutch
* English
* French
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Lithuanian
* Norwegian
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Slovenian


## 99% translated languages

… and almost fully translated (and validated) in the following 7 languages:

* German
* Persian
* Portuguese BR
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish

The 1.6.0.14 version is still available for translation - now is the time to complete translations! We'll let you know when we upload the newest dev version and consequently get rid of the 1.6.0.14 project on Crowdin.

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with the previous month, these languages had the best progress in June:

* Finnish (+39% to reach 78% translated)

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!!

We also have new active languages, thanks to translators who joined us to translate in Bulgarian and Tamil: welcome to the team!


## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

As you might know, a translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs translated string, to make sure everyone benefit from the latest translations!

These languages (still) need you as proofreaders as well:

* Turkish (89% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (75% vs 25%)
* Ukrainian (92% vs 48%)
* Vietnamese (42% vs 16%)
* Hungarian (96% vs 80%)

If you wish to help proofreading what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread.



## A word from the community

Here is an update on the latest initiatives from members of the translation community.

#### Luxembourgish
We've added this new language at the request of **NicoLux**, based on the available German translation. The more, the merrier: If you want to help translating PrestaShop in Luxembourgish, join the project and don't hesitate to get in touch with NicoLux! The focus is on the shop's, PDF and emails content mainly.

### Tatar
Another language added to the project (what a month!). Thanks to **Rinat Mirgazov** and **Gulnaz Valeeva** who provided the translations!
Tatars of the world, join your our project to keep PrestaShop it up-to-date in your language!

#### Polish
**Koral** has raised the flag regarding proofreading for the Polish project. It's almost fully translated, we would just need the strings to be validated to have it fully available in the software. There's not much to be validated, but it has to be done at some point. Speak up if you want to help!


## Miscellaneous
**95 contributors** joined the project this month, for a **total of 1,964 members** at the end of June. Welcome to them!
72 members (including PrestaShop employees) were active on the project this month (+20%).
A total of **51,058 words have been translated** (that's about 80% more than the previous month - wow!) and 28,131 validated, in 34 different languages - this is huge!

We can’t thank you enough!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it’s still time](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization (let’s dream a bit), do let us know, we’ll include a word in the next monthly report.
A question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment.

See you next month!
