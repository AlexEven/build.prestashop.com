## Why this blog

We decided to create this blog in order to communicate more closely with the community, especially those who contribute to the core.

This blog is about everything that has to do with PrestaShop development. It is written by the whole PrestaShop product team: developers, designers, writers, etc.

We write about the upcoming changes in the codebase, current and future architectures, or any behavior change that might affect you. You will also find a few How-Tos to learn how to use the new features -- information that will eventually find its way in the Developer Guide or the Designer Guide.

## Contribute

How about writing a guest post here? Maybe you've been working with PrestaShop for a while and you want to write about how you use it, or you feel a cool feature could use a highlight with sample code? Go ahead, suggest a new article â€” that might even inspire other people in the community to write too!

Before you start you can send us a short proposal at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}). Once we have agreed with you on the topic, you can submit your article using a simple pull request! Make sure you read the [How To Write On This Blog](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/how-to-write-on-this-blog/) tutorial first!
